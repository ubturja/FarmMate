- Batch creation and listing
- Real-time updates
- Form validation
- Responsive design
- Provenance tracking interface

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Simulated/Mock:**
- Blockchain transactions (no real smart contracts)
- AI analysis (mock responses)
- File storage (simulated IPFS)
- Database (in-memory, resets on restart)
- Wallet transactions (simulated)

### üöß **Not Implemented:**
- Real blockchain integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If Services Won't Start:
1. Check if ports 3000, 3001, or 5432 are already in use
2. Kill existing processes: `sudo kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)` (repeat for other ports)
3. Restart services in order: Database ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Frontend

### If Frontend Shows Errors:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
3. Restart frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`

### If Database Issues:
1. Check PostgreSQL container: `docker ps | grep postgres`
2. Restart container: `docker restart farmmate-postgres`
3. If still issues, recreate: `docker rm -f farmmate-postgres` then run the docker command again
